The encoder stack is composed of a stack of identical layers, each containing two sub-layers - a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. This is followed by a residual connection and layer normalization. The decoder stack is also composed of a stack of identical layers, with the addition of a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. This is also followed by residual connections and layer normalization. The main difference between the encoder and decoder stacks is that the decoder stack includes an encoder-decoder attention layer, while the encoder stack only contains self-attention layers. This allows the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence, while the encoder can only attend to positions in the previous layer of the encoder.'"
